# Parasite Fitness 

## Alizon (2013) & van Baalen & Sabelis (1995) Model

I am working on a coinfection model, which includes a transmission-virulence trade-off function. I am using the equation for parasite fitness and using the fitness gradient to see how the singular strategy is affected as the model parameters are altered.

I include the code for plots which show this singular strategy as one model parameters is altered before moving onto producing heatmaps so I can look at the singular strategy as two model parameters are altered simultaneously.
